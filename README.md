# WiDS_2018

The dataset for the challenge will contain demographic and behavioral information from a
representative sample of survey respondents from India and their usage of traditional financial
and mobile financial services. The dataset is a product of InterMedia’s research to help the
world’s poorest people take advantage of widely available mobile phones and other digital
technology to access financial tools and participate more fully in their local economies. Women
in these communities, in particular, are often largely excluded from the formal financial system.

By predicting gender, the datathon teams will explore the key differences in behavior patterns of
men and women, and how that may impact their use of new financial services. Ideally, these
findings will influence plans to reach women in developing economies and encourage them to
adopt new financial tools that will help to lift them and their families out of poverty.
The WiDS Datathon competition seeks to encourage women data scientists to engage in social
impact solutions by participating in a predictive analytics contest. The dataset for the challenge
will contain demographic and behavioral information from a representative sample of survey
respondents from India about their usage of traditional financial and mobile financial services.
Participants will analyze the data and build machine learning and statistical models to predict
the gender of each survey respondent.
